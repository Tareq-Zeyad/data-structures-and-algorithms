# Stacks and Queues

### Stacks:

Stacks are a type of data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Stacks follow these concepts:

FILO
First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

LIFO
Last In First Out


### Queues:

A data strucutre that the last item in it, will be the last item out of the it.

FIFO
First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

LILO
Last In Last Out


### Pseudo Queue:

A data strucutre that the first item in, will be the first item out

FIFO
First In First Out

LILO
Last In Last Out

## Challenge

Create **Stack** and **Queue** classes and implement their methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

### Approach taken:

TDD: Test Driven Development

### Efficiency:

All methods of both Stacks and Queues take O(1) as they are very efficent and don't use any sort of loop.

Pseudo Stack Enqueue O(1)

Pseudo Stack Dequeue O(n)

## API


### Stacks:

```
        Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed

        Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

        Top - This is the top of the stack.

        Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

        IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
```


### Queues:

```
        Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

        Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

        Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.

        Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

        Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

        IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
```

### PseudoQueues:

```
    Enqueue - Add an item to the queue.

    Dequeue - Remove an item from the queue(if none exist, an EmptyQueue error will be raised.)
```
