# Stacks and Queues

### Stacks:

### Stacks are a type of data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
<br>

### Stacks follow these concepts:

FILO
First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

LIFO
Last In First Out
<br>


### Queues:

### A data strucutre that the last item in it, will be the last item out of the it.
<br>


FIFO
First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

LILO
Last In Last Out

## Challenge

Create **Stack** and **Queue** classes and implement their methods. 

## Approach & Efficiency

### Approach taken:

TDD: Test Driven Development

### Efficiency:

All methods of both Stacks and Queues take O(1) as they are very efficent and don't use any sort of loop.

## API


### Stacks:

```
        Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed

        Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

        Top - This is the top of the stack.

        Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

        IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
```


### QueuesL

```
        Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

        Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

        Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.

        Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

        Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

        IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
```
