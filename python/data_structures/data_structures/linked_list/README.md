# Singly Linked List


### Create Node class and Linked list class to add new node that has a value and a reference to next node.
<br>



## Challenge
## its a challenge to make Linked list and start adding nodes that has a value and points to the next node and last node points to None

## Approach & Efficiency
## The Efficiency of Big O is O(n) linear.

## API
## We have 3 methods:
- ### **append method** : that used to add new node to the linked lists
- ### **search method**: that used to search for specific values in the linked list
- ### **str method**: to give a presenting way to the user when he prints the object after adding values for example
- ### **counter method** : to count how many times we added a value

## Task lists
- ### [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list

- ### [x] Can properly insert into the linked list

- ### [x] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- ### [x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- ### [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- ### [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- ### [x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
